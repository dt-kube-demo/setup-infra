# AWS bastion host overview

Below are instructions for using the gcloud CLI to provison an ubuntu virtual machine on Google. This bastion host will then be used to run the scripts to provision the GKE cluster, keptn, and application setup.

## 1. Create instance using aws cli

Run this commands on your laptop to create the bastion host.

```
# adjust these variables
export SSH_KEY=<your ssh aws key name>
export CLUSTER_REGION=<example us-west-2>

# provision the host
aws ec2 run-instances \
  --image-id ami-08692d171e3cf02d6 \
  --count 1 \
  --instance-type t2.micro \
  --key-name $SSH_KEY  \
  --associate-public-ip-address \
  --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=keptn-orders-bastion}]' \
  --region $CLUSTER_REGION
```

NOTE: You can also make the bastion host from the console, and the continue with the steps to connect using ssh.  But you must use this image as to have the install scripts be compatible.
* Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume TypeÂ - ami-08692d171e3cf02d6 (64-bit x86) / ami-05e1b2aec3b47890f (64-bit Arm)

## 2. SSH to the bastion host 

From the aws web console, get the SSH command to connect to the bastion host. For example:
```
ssh -i "<your pem file>.pem" ubuntu@<your host>.compute.amazonaws.com
```

REFERENCE: [aws docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html?icmpid=docs_ec2_console)

## 3. Initialize aws CLI on the bastion

Within the bastion host, run these commands to install the aws CLI 
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install awscli
```

Run this command to configure the cli 
```
aws configure
```

At the prompt, 
* enter your AWS Access Key ID
* enter your AWS Secret Access Key ID
* enter Default region name example us-east-1
* enter Default output format, enter json

See [this article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/wheres-my-secret-access-key/) for For help access keys

When complete, run this command ```aws ec2 describe-instances``` to see your VMs

## 4. Clone the Orders setup repo

Within the VM, run these commands to clone the setup repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/dt-kube-demo/setup-infra.git

cd setup-infra
```

Now proceed to the [Provision Cluster, Install Keptn, and onboard the Orders application](README.md#provision-cluster-install-keptn-and-onboard-the-orders-application) steps.

# Delete the bastion host

The the aws web console, choose VM and terminate it.
