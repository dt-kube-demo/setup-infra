# AWS bastion host overview

Below are instructions for using the AWS CLI to provison an ubuntu virtual machine on AWS. This bastion host will then be used to run the scripts to provision the GKE cluster and application setup.

# Create bastion host

Part of these instructions assume you have an AWS account and have the AWS CLI installed and configured locally.

See [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html) for local CLI installation and configuration.

You can also make the bastion host from the console and then continue with the steps to connect using ssh.  But you must use this image as to have the install scripts be compatible.

## 1. Provision bastion host using CLI

On your laptop, run these commands to create the bastion host.

```
# adjust these variables
export SSH_KEY=<your ssh aws key name>
export CLUSTER_REGION=<example us-west-2>

# provision the host
aws ec2 run-instances \
  --image-id ami-08692d171e3cf02d6 \
  --count 1 \
  --instance-type t2.micro \
  --key-name $SSH_KEY  \
  --associate-public-ip-address \
  --tag-specifications 'ResourceType=instance,Tags=[{Key=Name,Value=dt-kube-demo-bastion}]' \
  --region $CLUSTER_REGION
```

## 2. SSH to the bastion host 

From the aws web console, get the SSH command to connect to the bastion host. For example:
```
ssh -i "<your pem file>.pem" ubuntu@<your host>.compute.amazonaws.com
```

REFERENCE: [aws docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstances.html?icmpid=docs_ec2_console)

## 3. Initialize aws CLI on the bastion

Within the bastion host, run these commands to install the aws CLI 
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install awscli
```

Run this command to configure the cli 
```
aws configure
```

At the prompt, 
* enter your AWS Access Key ID
* enter your AWS Secret Access Key ID
* enter Default region name example us-east-1
* enter Default output format, enter json

See [this article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/wheres-my-secret-access-key/) for For help access keys

When complete, run this command ```aws ec2 describe-instances``` to see your VMs

## 4. Clone the Orders setup repo

Within the VM, run these commands to clone the setup repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/dt-kube-demo/setup-infra.git
cd setup-infra
```

Finally, proceed to the [Provision Cluster, Install Keptn, and onboard the Orders application](README.md#bastion-host-setup) step.

# Delete the bastion host

The the aws web console, choose VM and terminate it.
